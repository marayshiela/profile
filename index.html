      <h2>Art is like a Therapy.</h2>
      <p>What comes up is what comes up.</p>
      <p>It may be dark, but that’s what comes up.</p>
      <p>You may want to keep some of it in a drawer…</p>
      <p>BUT NEVER JUDGE IT.</p>

        <h3>Traditional and Digital Drawing</h3>
        <p>When I was a kid, I became fascinated by art. After seeing some of my brother's drawings,
          I told myself that I really wanted to draw. Drawing becomes an extension of myself.
          I used to scribble on the backs of my notebooks when I was a student, and I spent most of
          my summers doing art.</p><br />
        <p>Traditional art mediums that I frequently use include sketching, acrylic, watercolor,
          and scribble art. But after discovering vector art, I decided to do some digital art as
           well. It's great to find new ways to do things. It can really motivate you to do more.</p>

      <h2>My Artwork</h2>
      <p>I keep an Art Journal in which I draw people, places,
        or images that interest me, and I occasionally paint acrylic
        paintings on canvas. The majority of my art journal entries
        are also shared on Instagram.</p>
